osu! storyboard for my upcoming beatmap.
Not really optimized but it works.

Todo list if I have time:
- Flash effect (nope too lazy)
- HitObject highlighting (non)
- Extra scenes/SDs (no)
- Add some particles (added)

Code taken from various other projects and modified to my own liking for the storyboard.

I like Yuzusoft games. Go play them.
